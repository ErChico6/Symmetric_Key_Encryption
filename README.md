# Symmetric_Key_Encryption
Using character and bigram frequency we will try to decrypt a message encrypted with symmetric key encryption

#Skeleton
Symmetric Key Encryption works using: a plaintext, a ciphertext and a key.
Our algorithm must be able to obtain the frequency of the most common characters of the original plaintext, the frequency of the most common characters  of the ciphertext and then swap them.

Then we will procede doing the same things, but with bigrams, since this is probably a better strategy.

Functions initially needed for the first part:

- one for cleaning the file for sure, since probably there are characters pointless, and also we must convert upper case characters to lower case ones

- one for counting the frequencies of the different characters and store them (possibly in a dictionary for simplicity)

- find a way to create a key with this frequencies

- create the final function that decrypt the cipher text using the key just created
